# Atlas Private 
Atlas is a new Bee Swarm Simulator script currently being developed with safety and performance as its focus. Atlas supports both tween and pathfinding and fires no remotes.
The normal Atlas is good but this is for people who got access to private. it has a whitelist so dont even try to use it if u do not have access to private.
